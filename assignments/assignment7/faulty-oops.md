###Analysis:

- This error shows that kernel has attempted to dereference a NULL pointer while trying to access memory located at virtual address 0.
- CM =0 which means fault didnt happen during cache maintainence.
- WnR=1 which means fault happened during write operation.
- it also indicates that the user page table is 4K pages and has 39 bit virtual addresses.
- The PGD, P4D and PUD are 0 which meanes the virtal addresses are 0 , which leads to a page fault.
- Error gives information about the modules which are loaded with hello(O) scull(O) faulty(O)
- The eroor shows where the process has failed in the last section. Here we can know thet the process Id was 159, and the command was 'sh'.
- In the call trace we can see that the error occured due to an error while doing a faulty_write.
- The error occurred at byte offset 0x14 which is 20bytes in a function of 0x20 or 32 bytes long.

  18:   d65f03c0        ret

```
- As it says that the error happend at 0x14 that means it has happened at the instruction str wzr,[x1].
